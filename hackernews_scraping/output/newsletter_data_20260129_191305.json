Domain should  never depend on infrastructure or application layer and so on. But the projects I got have domain that depend on infrastructure and another one where application has a reference directly to infrastructure and been told that this is correct implementation... doh..<p>I think I was kind of a good at listening for the lectures, but I now am doubting about, whether it was worth learning stuff at all lol since it&#x27;s so controversial out there. I am, of course, in no position to question senior dev, but what do you guys think - is it really normal that all the college so called &quot;best practices&quot; go straight to the trash bin or am I just misunderstanding the real-work-like context?"

From what I’ve heard, at this scale only a few tools (like Claude’s desktop app) are genuinely helpful, so I haven’t experimented much with other AI coding services.<p>At the same time, I keep seeing posts about people building 20k lines of code and launching a SaaS in a single 40-hour weekend. That’s made me question whether I’m being overly cautious, or just operating under outdated assumptions.<p>I already rely on AI quite a bit, and one clear benefit is that I now understand parts of the codebase that I previously wrote without fully grasping. Still, at my current pace, it feels like I’ll need several more months of development, followed by several more months of testing, before this can become a real production service. And that testing doesn’t feel optional.<p>Meanwhile, products that are described as being “vibe coded” don’t seem to be getting particularly negative evaluations.<p>So I’m wondering how people here think about this now.\nIs “you don’t really understand the code, so it’ll hurt you later” still a meaningful criticism?\nOr are we reaching a point where the default approach to building software itself needs to change?<p>I’d especially appreciate perspectives from people working on larger or more complex systems."

Beyond just literature reviews, it could act as a brainstorming co-pilot.<p>Has anyone here seriously used AI (e.g., Claude for long-context paper analysis, custom GPTs on arXiv, or specialized agents) to aid in hypothesis generation, research gap identification, or drafting substantive parts of a paper?<p>What are the biggest pitfalls regarding accuracy, hallucination of citations, or superficial understanding of complex theory? How do you validate the AI&#x27;s output?<p>Do you see it as a legitimate accelerator for early-stage research, or more of a productivity tool for mundane tasks? Any success stories linking it to a tangible research outcome?<p>Looking for honest experiences from academics, industry researchers, or solo discoverers."

        "text": "I’ve never been able to maintain enough focus on a timer. The temptation to get distracted is always strong—and since it’s easy to ignore the timer, I often did.<p>After failing to follow the Pomodoro method, I’d feel irritated, frustrated, and blame myself. Soon enough, the routine would fall apart, and I’d go back to working in my usual way—without boundaries or timers.<p>Then I had an epiphany: focusing on the timer forces you into a battle with yourself. And since it’s hard to fight your own subconscious micro-reactions and habits, you end up frustrated. Sticking rigidly to a timer is the wrong goal. The real goal should be taking regular breaks—focus will follow naturally.<p>To test this idea, I created &quot;Black Screen for Windows&quot; — an app that forcibly blacks out my screens for a few minutes at regular intervals. Usually, that’s 3–5 minutes every 20–30 minutes.<p>This practice of enforced, regular breaks has not only improved my well-being but also dramatically boosted my productivity—all without the frustration. My ability to focus improved, too, with a small hack: I start with a 30-minute interval, then gradually shorten it until I find a span of time in which I can maintain clean, distraction-free focus.<p>I find this works better for me than the classic tier-based Pomodoro.<p>What do you think?"
